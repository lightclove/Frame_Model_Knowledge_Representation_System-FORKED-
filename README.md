Frame Model Knowledge Representation System (FORKED)
The main advantage of frames as a model of knowledge representation is that it reflects the conceptual basis of organizing human memory, as well as its flexibility and visualization.
The most clearly the advantages of framework systems of knowledge of knowledge are manifested if the birth relations change infrequently and the subject area has a little exceptions.
In framework systems, data on the ties are clearly stored, as well as knowledge of other types.
The values of the slots are presented in the system in a single copy, since they are included only in one frame that describes the most concepts of all those that contain a slot with this name.
This property of frames systems ensures economical placement of knowledge base in computer memory. Another advantage of frames is that the value of any slot can be calculated
Using appropriate procedures or found by heuristic methods. That is, the frames allow manipulating both declarative and procedural knowledge.
The disadvantages of framework systems include their relatively high complexity, which is manifested in a decrease in the speed of the mechanism for the output and increase the complexity of making changes to the birth hierarchy.
Therefore, when developing framework systems, they are given to visual methods of display and effective means of editing framework structures.
Special languages of knowledge representations in the FRL FRAM FRAMES (FRAME ReprySentation Language), KRL (Knowledge Representation Language), the framework of Kappa, Pilot/2 and other software allowing industrial systems to build.
In recent years, the term “framework” is often replaced by the term “object-oriented”. This approach is the development of a framework representation. The Frame Template can be considered as a class, an instance of the frame - as an object.
Languages of object-oriented programming (OOP) provide means of creating classes and objects, as well as means for describing the processing procedures (methods).
OOP languages that do not contain the means of implementing the procedures do not allow organizing a flexible mechanism of logical output, therefore, the programs developed on them either represent object-oriented databases, or require integration with other means of knowledge processing (for example, with the PROLOG language).
The object-oriented methodology for representing knowledge is implemented in G2, RTWORKS systems.

The problem of representing and processing knowledge is a key
for the field of artificial intelligence. From the successful solution of it,
The effectiveness and "intellectuality" of applied programs depends mediocre.

Unlike the paradigm "Data+Program", which is used in traditional programming systems, in systems
Artificial intelligence is more typical of the paradigm of "knowledge+conclusion". According to one of the "definitions" "knowledge is formalized information that is referred to or used in the process of logical conclusion."
Elements of knowledge never exist in isolation - they are always united by connections with others

elements and therefore it makes sense to talk about the bases of knowledge

With the development of computer technology, the meaning invested in the concept of the information system has changed. A modern information system is a set of information technologies aimed at supporting the life cycle of information and including three main processes: data processing, information management and knowledge management. In the context of a sharp increase in the volume of information, the transition to working with knowledge based on artificial intelligence is, in all likelihood, the only alternative to the information society [85].
According to D.A. Pospelova, "the system is called intellectual if
The following basic functions are implemented:

to accumulate knowledge about the world around the world, classify and evaluate them from the point of view of pragmatic utility and consistency, initiate the processes of gaining new knowledge, and carry out correlation of new knowledge with previously stored;
to replenish the knowledge received through a logical conclusion that reflects patterns in the world around the world in the previously accumulated knowledge, to gain generalized knowledge based on more private knowledge and logically plan their activities;
communicate with a person in a language as close as possible to the natural human language;
receive information from channels similar to those used by a person in the perception of the world;
To be able to form for yourself or at the request of a person (user) an explanation of your own activity;
Provide the user at the expense of those knowledge that are stored in the memory, and those logical means of reasoning that are inherent in the system. "
The frame is called the data structure for the presentation and description of stereotypical objects, events or situations. The framework model of knowledge presentation consists of two parts:

set of frames that make up the library within the knowledge presented;
mechanisms of their transformation, binding and etc.
There are two types of frames:
sample (prototype) - an intensive description of a certain set of copies;
A copy (example) is an extensional representation of a frame-image.
In general, the frame can be represented by the following motorcade:

As data, the frame may contain appeals to the procedures (the so -called
Antigned procedures). Two types of procedures are distinguished: demon procedures and
Service procedures. Demones are activated at every attempt to add
Or removing data from the slot. Service procedures are activated only with
fulfilling the conditions defined by the user when creating a frame.

Productive models are a set of rules of the type of “conditions-action”, where the conditions are allegations of the content of the database, and actions are procedures that can change the contents of the database.
Formally, products are determined as follows:

Almost products are built according to the “if” scheme (cause or, otherwise, package),
"That" (investigation or, in other way, the purpose of the rule).
The new knowledge obtained as a result of the operation of products can be used for the following purposes:
understanding and interpretation of facts and rules using products, frames, semantic chains;
solving problems using modeling;
Identification of the source of data, the reasons for the discrepancies of new knowledge with the old, the acquisition of metakes;
compilation of questions to the system;
The assimilation of new knowledge, elimination of contradictions, systematization of excess data.
The process of considering a comprehensive set of rules (implementation of the program) is called consultation. Its form most convenient for the user is a friendly dialogue with a computer. The interface can be in the form of a menu, in the language of commands and in a natural language.
The dialogue can be built on a system of questions asked by the user, computer, or facts - data stored in the database. A mixed option is possible when there are not enough facts in the database.
With a direct search, the user can ask two groups of questions to which the computer gives explanations:
How a decision is obtained. In this case, the computer must issue a track to the screen in the form of links to the used rules;
Why did the computer ask some question. At the same time, a kind of route is given to the screen, which the computer would like to use to withdraw after receiving an answer to the question asked. The question is why it can be asked both in the process of consultation and after the program.
The search algorithm implemented by logical languages ​​is specific: it is actually a consistent break on wood from top to bottom - from left to right.
